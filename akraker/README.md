This is just a few Bash examples written by 
[Alex Kraker](https://github.com/kraker).

## DB2 Backup Script

* `db2_backup`

This script is probably not very useful outside of it's context. I wrote this
to solve a problem at work... But, I made an extra effort to conform to the 
[Google Shell Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) and 
utilize best-practices, etc. I'm including it here, hopefully to provide an 
example or something to use as a source of inspiration.

Feel free to ping me with any comments, questions, or suggestions!

(Pull requests welcome if you feel you have something to add to it too)

Usage, description, and other info is all in the comments, so I won't bother
repeating myself here.
